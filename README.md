# ST7528i
Library for I2C graphical LCD based on Sitronix ST7528i controller (16 grayscale levels).

This library is based on the work done by LonelyWolf and his ST7528 SPI library: https://github.com/LonelyWolf/stm32/tree/master/ST7528

I'm using the NHD-C160100DiZ-FSW-FBW COG (Chip-On-Glass) Liquid Crystal Display Module.

NHD- Newhaven Display<br>
C160100- 160 x 100 Pixels<br>
DiZ- Model (I²C)<br>
F- Transflective<br>
SW- Side White LED Backlight<br>
F- FSTN, Positive<br>
B- 6:00 Optimal View<br>
W- Wide Temp<br>
<br>
This library is a work-in-progress and will change quite a bit over time.
